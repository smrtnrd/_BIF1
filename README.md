# Applied Bioinformatics - (BIOL 5516W / BNF 5107)

The goals of this course are (1) to learn the basics of programming in Python, and (2) to become familiar with tools for the analysis of biological data. By the end of this class, successful students will understand and apply fundamental programming concepts (e.g., variables and control structures), will demonstrate the use of BioPython and graphical functions, and will integrate these concepts by writing their own programs for the analysis of biological data.
