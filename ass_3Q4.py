# Create a function that takes two arguments: a short DNA motif (e.g., ‘GACA’),
# and another DNA sequence. The function should report back on whether the
# motif is found in the DNA sequence. Demonstrate the use of this function by
# calling it twice: once where the motif is found in the DNA sequence, and once
# where it isn’t.
